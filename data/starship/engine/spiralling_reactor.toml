    Telescope rotary engine which seems to be violently
    ripped from unspoken foundations of Manser's Observatory.

    The innerworkings of the engine are yet
    to be fully understood, but it fits finely
    into our ship's structure and produces just enough
    energy to sustain relatively small yet armed spacecraft 
    under placed upon it restrains.

    Just be couceous of it's reality-bending
    properties and keep an eye or two on
    taking sure it won't go critical,
    - neither you nor your collegues would like
    to see that happening in proximity of
    anybodies' home planet.
