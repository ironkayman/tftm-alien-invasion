## Introduction

---

_Rescently I was approached by ETE representative with a quite a job of restoring some scrambled data off the ETE-labeled and sealed hard drives. As he said, the containers, which are most of the time are shielded from a such event affecting the disks, were in fact affected by manifested nearby breach of a much higher than extected magnitude. As a result, most of the storage facilites inside the building, including the building itself were altered beyond recognition, you probably heard about it - suprisingly, no casualties only a massive property damage despite a gruesome look of it. Notably, no watchtowers forecasted such breach taking place, which is alarming to say at least. All in all since the damage was too great for a conventional restorative techniques that's were I come in: ETE says that such outsourcing is beneficial in a long run both for us due to sheer difficulty of the case, their public image, and the ETE's archival puposes, but I suppose there's more to it - Everexpanding Toybox has no less than a massive division of high-class restorative scientists working on same issues._

_Anyway, they are fine with me taking time with this project as long as at least something representing the original will turn out. The source in this repository is everything I managed to recover so far and reconstruct in a cohesive more-or-less working state with a hefty amount of my own's work patched in where recovery is too risky for a time being._

_I'll update the source as soon as I can recover it and throw in together some working version._
