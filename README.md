`TFtM: Alien Invasion` is a pet project unfiction classic space invaders-like arcade shmup written on python 3 and [arcade](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade) library based around the lore of **Maelstrom Takes Toll** fictional universe and its canon body of stories under **Tales from the Maelstrom** umbrella.

## Introduction
```
This game was found on Everexpanding Toybox Entertainment corporate hard drives after tonal shift
hit the gamedev wing of an office.
Since all the mess the deparment was significantly shrunk down to focus on remaining projects
worth on persuit and some equipment was auctioned and resold multiple times.

I was approached by company itself some time later to restore data
as a data recovery freelancer with a permission to open source the restored data
and company public archival puposes.
Data restoration from narraphysic influence is a profitable source of income nowdays.
Turns out the data itself was pretty corrupt so I said it'll take time - they're fine with that
as long as at least something representing the original concept will work.

The source in this repository is everything I managed to recover by far and reconstruct
in a cohesive more-or-less working state with a hefty amount of my own's work patched in
where recovery is too risky and/or entirely impossible
due to disks' narrative identity being completely scrambled all over the place.

I'll update the source as soon as I can recover it and throw in together some working version.
