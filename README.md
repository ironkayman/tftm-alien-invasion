## Introduction
```
This game was found on Everexpanding Toybox Entertainment corporate hard drives after tonal shift
hit the gamedev wing of an office.
Since all the mess settled the deparment was significantly shrunk down to focus on remaining projects
worth on persuit while some equipment was auctioned and resold multiple times until
it was impossible to track it or the transactions.

Meanwhile I was approached by ETE representative to restore data on those drives
as a data recovery freelancer with a permission to open source the restored data
for company public archival puposes.

Data restoration from narraphysic influence is a profitable source of income nowdays.
Turns out the data itself was pretty corrupt so I said it'll take some time -
they're fine with that as long as at least something representing the original will work.

The source in this repository is everything I managed to recover by far and reconstruct
in a cohesive more-or-less working state with a hefty amount of my own's work patched in
where recovery is too risky and/or entirely impossible
due to disks' narrative identity being completely scrambled.

I'll update the source as soon as I can recover it and throw in together some working version.
